# Routing

Nitro support filesystem routing to define handler as well as defining route rules for maximum flexibility and performance.

A handle is a function that will be binded to a route and executed when the route is matched by the router for an incoming request.

## Filesystem Routing

Nitro supports file-based routing for your API routes (file are atomatically mapped to [unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) routes). Defining a route is as simple as creating a file inside the `api/` or `routes/` directory.

You can only define one handler per files and you can [append the HTTP method](#specific-request-method) to the filename to define a specific request method.

```md
api/
  test.ts      <-- /api/test
routes/
  hello.get.ts     <-- GET /hello
  hello.post.ts    <-- POST /hello
nitro.config.ts
```

::alert{type=primary}
Some providers like Vercel use a top-level `api/` directory as a feature, therefore routes placed in `/api` wont work.
You will have to use `routes/api/`.
::

::alert
If you are using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), move the `api/` and `routes/` inside the `server/` directory.
::

### Simple route

First, create a file in `routes/` or `api/` directory. The filename will be the route path.

Then, export a function wrapped in `defineEventHandler` that will be executed when the route is matched.

```ts [/api/test.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
  return { hello: 'API' }
})
```

You do not need to import `defineEventHandler` as it is automatically imported thanks to [auto-import feature](/guide/auto-imports).

### Route with params

#### Single param

To define a route with params, use the `[<param>]` syntax where `<param>` is the name of the param. The param will be available in the `event.context.params` object or using the `getRouterParam` utility from [unjs/h3](https://h3.unjs.io).

```ts [/routes/hello/[name\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')

  return `Hello ${name}!`
})
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro!
```

#### Multiple params

You can define multiple params in a route using `[<param1>]/[<param2>]` syntax where each param is a folder. You **cannot** define multiple params in a single filename of folder.

```ts [/routes/hello/[name\\]/[age\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')
  const age = getRouterParam(event, 'age')

  return `Hello ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`
})
```

#### Catch all params

You can capture all the remaining parts of a URL using `[...<param>]` syntax. This will include the `/` in the param.

```ts [/routes/hello/[...name\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const name = getRouterParam(event, 'name')

  return `Hello ${name}!`
})
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro/is/hot`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro/is/hot!
```

### Specific request method

You can append the HTTP method to the filename to force the route to be matched only for a specific HTTP request method, for example `hello.get.ts` will only match for `GET` requests. You can use any HTTP method you want.

::code-group
```js [GET]
// routes/users/[id].get.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const id = getRouterParam(event, 'id')

  // Do something with id

  return `User profile!`
})
```

```js [POST]
// routes/users.post.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async event => {
  const body = await readBody(event)

  // Do something with body like saving it to a database

  return { updated: true }
})
```
::

Check out [h3 JSDocs](https://www.jsdocs.io/package/h3) for all available utilities like `getRouterParam` or `readBody`.

### Catch all route

You can create a special route that will match all routes that are not matched by any other route. This is useful for creating a default route.

To create a catch all route, create a file named `[...].ts` in the `routes/` or `api/` directory or in any subdirectory.

```ts [/routes/[...\\].ts]
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  const url = getRequestURL(event)

  return `Hello ${url}!`
})
```

## Route Rules

Nitro allows you to add logic at the top-level for each route of your configuration. It can be used for redirecting, proxying, caching and adding headers to routes.

It is a map from route pattern (following [unjs/radix3](https://github.com/unjs/radix3#route-matcher)) to route options.

When `cache` option is set, handlers matching pattern will be automatically wrapped with `defineCachedEventHandler`. See the [guide cache](/guide/cache) to learn more about this function.

::alert
`swr: true|number` is shortcut for `cache: { swr: true, maxAge: number }`
::

You can set route rules in `nitro.config.ts` using the `routeRules` option.

::code-group
```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineNitroConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': { swr: true },
    '/blog/**': { swr: 600 },
    '/blog/**': { static: true },
    '/blog/**': { cache: { /* cache options*/ } },
    '/assets/**': { headers: { 'cache-control': 's-maxage=0' } },
    '/api/v1/**': { cors: true, headers: { 'access-control-allow-methods': 'GET' } },
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' },
    '/proxy/example': { proxy: 'https://example.com' },
    '/proxy/**': { proxy: '/api/**' },
  }
})
```
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': { swr: true },
    '/blog/**': { swr: 600 },
    '/blog/**': { static: true },
    '/blog/**': { cache: { /* cache options*/ } },
    '/assets/**': { headers: { 'cache-control': 's-maxage=0' } },
    '/api/v1/**': { cors: true, headers: { 'access-control-allow-methods': 'GET' } },
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' },
    '/proxy/example': { proxy: 'https://example.com' },
    '/proxy/**': { proxy: '/api/**' },
  }
})
```

## Route Middleware

Nitro route middleware can hook into the request lifecycle.

::alert{type=primary}
A middleware can modify the request before it is processed, not after.
::

Middleware are auto-registered within the `middleware/` directory.

```md
routes/
  hello.ts
middleware/
  auth.ts
  logger.ts
  ...
nitro.config.ts
```

### Simple Middleware

Middleware are defined exactly like route handlers with the only exception that they should not return anything.
Returning from middleware behaves like returning from a request - the value will be returned as a response and further code will not be ran.

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Extends or modify the event
  event.context.user = { name: 'Nitro' }
})
```

Middleware in `middleware/` directory are automatically registered for all routes. If you want to register a middleware for a specific route, see [Object Syntax Event Handler](#object-syntax-event-handler).

::alert
Returning anything from a middleware will close the request and should be avoided! Any returned value from middleware will be the response and further code will not be executed however **this is not recommended to do!**
::

### Execution Order

Middleware are executed in directory listing order.

```md
middleware/
  auth.ts <-- First
  logger.ts <-- Second
  ... <-- Third
```

Prefix middleware with a number to control their execution order.

```md
middleware/
  1.logger.ts <-- First
  2.auth.ts <-- Second
  3.... <-- Third
```

### Request Filtering

Middleware are executed on every request.

Apply custom logic to scope them to specific conditions.

For example, you can use the URL to apply a middleware to a specific route:

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Will only execute for /auth route
  if (getRequestURL(event).pathname.startsWith('/auth')) {
    event.context.user = { name: 'Nitro' }
  }
})
```

## Object Syntax Event Handler

Since H3@1.8, you can use a new object syntax to define event handler.

::alert{type=primary}
Read the announcement on the [UnJS blog](https://unjs.io/blog/2023-08-15-h3-towards-the-edge-of-the-web#object-syntax-event-handlers).
::

You can start by defining middleware in a file like `utils/auth.ts` to be able to auto-import them in your routes:

```ts [utils/auth.ts]
export const auth = defineRequestMiddleware((event) => {
  event.context.auth = { name: 'admin' }
})
```

```ts [utils/log.ts]
export const log = defineRequestMiddleware((event) => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

Then, you can use them in your routes:

```ts [routes/hello.ts]
export default eventHandler({
  onRequest: [auth],
  onBeforeResponse: [log],
  async handler(event) {
    return `Hello ${event.context.auth?.name || 'Guest'}`
  },
})
```

This synxtax allows you to order and define middleware before the handler and before the response.
