# Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Better introduction Under the hood, Nitro is using [h3](https://h3.unjs.io) as HTTP framework, embeds many utilities (file routing, storage, cache...) and preconfigured packages like [unimports](https://unimports.unjs.io) or [unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io) and provide a set of presets to deploy your server anywhere.

Now you know what Nitro is, let's get started and create your first Nitro app!

-->

## Play Online

The easiest way to get started with Nitro is to use the online playground.

## Starter Template

::callout
#summary
Make sure you have installed the recommended setup:
#content
* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) ðŸ‘‰ [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **Visual Studio Code**  [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for using pnpm and yarn. ðŸ‘‰ Run `corepack enable`
::

Create a new project using starter template:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

```bash [bun]
bunx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

::

```sh
cd nitro-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
```

```bash [bun]
bun install
```

::

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Nitro is ready at `http://localhost:3000/`!

::alert
Check `.nitro/dev/index.mjs` if want to know what is happening
::

Build your production-ready server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in the `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any provider with no dependencies.

You can try it locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can find more examples in the Nitro repository: [unjs/nitro/examples](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/tree/main/examples)
::

### Files

The starter template some important files to get you started.

`package.json`

The `package.json` file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your project.

`nitro.config.ts`

The `nitro.config.ts` file contains the configuration for Nitro.

`tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript configuration for your project. It extends an automatically generated `./.nitro/types/tsconfig.json` file that contains the configuration for Nitro.

You can use `npm run prepare` to generate some Nitro files in `.nitro` directory.

::alert{type="info"}
Do not change this file directly, use `typescript` key in `nitro.config.ts` instead.
::

`routes/**/*.{ts,js}`

The `routes` directory contains your application handlers. You can create subdirectories inside `routes` to create nested handlers. The file name is the route path.

## Nightly Release Channel

Nitro offers a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

::code-group
```diff [Nitro]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "^2.0.0"
++    "nitropack": "npm:nitropack-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```
```diff [Nuxt]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nuxt": "^3.0.0"
++    "nuxt": "npm:nuxt3@latest"
  }
}
```
::

::alert
If you are using Nuxt, [use the Nuxt nightly channel](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel#opting-in) as it already includes `nitropack-nightly`.
::

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.
