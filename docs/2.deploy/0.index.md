# Overview

Nitro can generate different output formats suitable for different hosting providers from the same code base.

Using built-in presets, you can easily configure Nitro to adjust its output format with almost no additional code or configuration!

## Default output

The default production output preset is [Node.js server](/deploy/node).

When running Nitro in development mode, Nitro will always use a special preset called `nitro-dev` using Node.js with ESM in an isolated Worker environment with behavior as close as possible to the production environment.


## Zero-Config Providers

When deploying to production using CI/CD, Nitro tries to automatically detect the provider environment and set the right one without any additional configuration required. Currently, the providers below can be auto-detected with zero config.

- [aws amplify](/deploy/providers/aws-amplify)
- [azure](/deploy/providers/azure)
- [cloudflare pages](/deploy/providers/cloudflare#cloudflare-pages)
- [netlify](/deploy/providers/netlify)
- [stormkit](/deploy/providers/stormkit)
- [vercel](/deploy/providers/vercel)
- [zeabur](/deploy/providers/zeabur)

## Changing the deployment preset

If you need to build Nitro against a specific provider, you can target it by defining an environment variable named `NITRO_PRESET` or `SERVER_PRESET`, or by updating your Nitro [configuration](/guide/configuration) or using `--preset` argument.

Using the environment variable approach is recommended for deployments depending on CI/CD.

**Example:** Defining a `NITRO_PRESET` environment variable
```bash
nitro build --preset cloudflare_pages
```

**Example:** Updating the `nitro.config.ts` file

```ts
export default defineNitroConfig({
  preset: 'cloudflare_pages'
})
```
