# Utils

Nitro helps you to stay organized allowing you to take advantage of the [`auto-imports`](auto-imports.md) feature.

Every export in the `utils` directory and its subdirectories will become available globally in your application.

---

**Example:** Create a `utils/sum.ts` file where a function `useSum` is exported:

```ts [utils/sum.ts]
export function useSum(a: number, b: number) { return a + b }
```

Use it in your `routes/index.ts` file without importing it:

```ts [routes/index.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
  const sum = useSum(1, 2) // auto-imported
  return { sum }
})
```

## Experimental Composition API

Nitro (2.6+) enables a new server development experience in order to split application logic into smaller "composable" utilities that are fully decoupled from each other and can directly assess to a shared context (request event) without needing it to be passed along. This pattern is inspired from [Vue Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html#why-composition-api) and powered by [unjs/unctx](https://github.com/unjs/unctx).

This feature is currently supported for Node.js and Bun runtimes and also coming soon to other presets that support [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) interface.

In order to enable composition API, you have to enable `asyncContext` flag:

::code-group
```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineNitroConfig({
  experimental: {
    asyncContext: true
  }
});
```
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    experimental: {
      asyncContext: true
    }
  }
})
```
::

After enabling this flag, you can use `useEvent()` (auto imported) in any utility or composable to access the request event without manually passing it along:

::code-group
```ts [with async context]
// routes/index.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  const user = await useAuth()
})

// utils/auth.ts
export function useAuth() {
  return useSession(useEvent())
}
```
```ts [without async context]
// routes/index.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const user = await useAuth(event)
})

// utils/auth.ts
export function useAuth(event) {
  return useSession(event)
}
```
