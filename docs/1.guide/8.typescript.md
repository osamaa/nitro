# TypeScript Support

Nitro supports TypeScript by default. If you are using the starter template, you have nothing to do :sparkles:.

To add type hints within your project, create a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "extends": "./.nitro/types/tsconfig.json"
}
```

Run `npx nitropack prepare` to generate the types for global auto-imports. This can be useful in a CI environment or as a `postinstall` command in your `package.json`.

If you are using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), your `tsconfig.json` can stay:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"
}
```
